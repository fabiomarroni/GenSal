# GenSal
Scripts and functions generated in the framework of **GenSal** project.
We *tried* to put all the scripts and functions in the correct order.
The prefix **a** denotes the analysis devoted to genetic structure and detection of signatures, and the prefix **b** denotes analysis performed for the functional annotation of regions under selection and testing for enrichment in functional classes.
As a general rule, scripts are executed first, and they usually call R functions.
You will need to create a few path variables.
Scripts and functions are generally commented, and you should be able to walk your way throusgh them. 
If this is not the case, drop us a line.
